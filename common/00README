NSRR resources

annots.alias		Annotation remapping terms

sigs.alias		EDF channel alias terms  

sigs.canonical  	For use with Luna CANONICAL command

sigs.types		Defines channel types: EEG, EMG, etc (for plotting)


The common/ folder contains information that is common to all NSRR studies

The studies/*/ folders contain study-specific information

Expected usage is that both common and study-specific information may be combined, 
 and if there are differences, the study-specific information will be preferred
 i.e. if using Luna @includes
 
 luna s.lst @~/nsrr/common/sigs.alias @~/nsrr/studies/xxx/sigs.alias 

Here, any additional/different aliases will overwrite the common values

Hint: in practice, when working with a given dataset, probably useful to define
a shell variable to keep all these

inc="@~/nsrr/common/sigs.alias @~/nsrr/studies/xxx/sigs.alias @~/nsrr/common/annots.alias @~/nsrr/studies/xxx/annots.alias"

and then

 luna s.lst @${inc} -o out.db < commands
